            <h2>Game Rules</h2>
            <p>The game is played by two players, and each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an
                outstretched hand. The possible shapes are:</p>
            <li>Rock: Represented by a fist.z</li>
            <li>Paper: Represented by an open hand.</li>
            <li>Scissors: Represented by a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V.</li>

            <p>Each of these shapes beats or loses to the other in a specific way:</p>
            <li>Rock crushes Scissors (Rock wins).</li>
            <li>Scissors cuts Paper (Scissors wins).</li>
            <li>Paper covers Rock (Paper wins).</li>

            <p>If both players choose the same shape, the round is a tie.</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Two players face each other and count down, saying “Rock, Paper,
                    Scissors, Shoot” or

                <li><strong>Making a Choice:</strong> On "shoot" (or "3"), both players make one of the three hand
                    gestures
                    simultaneously.</li>
                <li><strong>Determine the Winner:</strong> Based on the rules above, determine the winner of the round:
                    <ul>
                        <li>If one player’s hand shape beats the other, they win.</li>
                        <li>If both choose the same shape, it’s a tie, and they go again.</li>
